# ShareAdd.jl

This Julia package is intended for interactive use. It exports the macro `@usingany`: This macro makes package(s) available, if they are not already, and loads them with `using` keyword.

- If a package is available in an environment in LOAD_PATH, that's OK.
- If a package is available in a [shared environment](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/environments/#Shared-environments), this environment will be pushed into LOAD_PATH.
- Otherwise if it can be installed, you will be prompted to select an environment to install the package(s).
- If the package is not listed in any registry, an error will be thrown. 

```
# simplest usage case
@usingany SomePackage
```

The package also exports several utility functions - see the [Exported functions](@ref) section.

## Usage example

Let's assume, while working on your package `MyPackage`, we temporarily need packages `TOML`, `Plots`, and `Chairmarks`. However, they shouldn't be added permanently to your package dependencies. Furthermore, from the package `BenchmarkTools` we need only the macro `@btime` and the function `save`. We also need `Unitful`, which is already an installed dependence of `MyPackage`.

`TOML` is available in the `stdlib`, `Plots` and `BenchmarkTools` you already put into a shared environment `@utilities`, and `Chairmarks` is not on your computer yet. 

Now, first, you add ShareAdd to your "main" (standard) enviroment, making it available at all times:

```
]
(YourEnv) pkg> activate 
  Activating project at `~/.julia/environments/v1.10`

(@v1.10) pkg> add ShareAdd
(...)
(@v1.10) pkg> activate . # back to your environment
(YourEnv) pkg> 
```

By that occasion you may also want to clean your standard environment: It is generally not recommended having a lot of packages there.

Now, the only thing you need is to type into REPL (or adding to your script) the following lines:

```
using ShareAdd
@usingany Unitful, TOML, Plots, Chairmarks
@usingany BenchmarkTools: @btime, save
```

As `Chairmarks` was not installed yet, you will be asked as to where to install it. You may e.g. add it to your existing `@utilities` shared environment, or let create a new environment `@Chairmarks` and put it there. 

Afrerwards `@utilities` (and `@Chairmarks`, if created) will be added to `LOAD_PATH`, making their packages available.

Finally, the macros will execute `using Unitful, TOML, Plots, Chairmarks` resp. `using BenchmarkTools: @btime, save` - and that's it. Enjoy!

## Other functions and usage cases

The functions [`list_shared_pkgs()`](@ref) and [`list_shared_envs()`](@ref) do what their names say.

```
list_shared_pkgs() # return names of packages in all shared envs except those in the the "main" one
```
```
list_shared_pkgs("@SomeEnv") # return packages in the shared env "SomeEnv"
```
```
list_shared_envs() # names of all shared envs
```
```
list_shared_envs("SomePkg") # envs which contain the package "SomePkg"
```

The function [`make_importable`](@ref) also does what it says. It is used internally by [`@usingany`](@ref), but it can also be used separately in special cases, e.g. if you need `using A as B` syntax, or want to import a package via `import` statement instead of `using`:

```
using ShareAdd
make_importable("Foo")
import Foo
```

It is possible to first update the packages and/or environments by setting the corresponding kwarg. E.g. the following would update the 
packages `Pkg1`, `Pkg2` in their shared environments:

```
using ShareAdd
@usingany update_pkg = true Pkg1, Pkg2
```

For more usage options see [`@usingany` docs](@ref) .
